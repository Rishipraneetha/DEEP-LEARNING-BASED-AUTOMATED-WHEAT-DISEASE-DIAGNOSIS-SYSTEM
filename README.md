# 🌾 Deep Learning-Based Automated Wheat Disease Diagnosis System

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system to automatically diagnose common wheat leaf diseases: **Healthy**, **Rust**, and **Leaf Blight**. It is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, and leverages data augmentation techniques for robust performance on agricultural datasets.

## 🚀 Features

- Classifies wheat leaf images into 3 categories: Healthy, Rust, Leaf Blight
- Real-time prediction on new images
- Uses data augmentation to prevent overfitting
- Training/validation performance visualization
- Easily extendable and deployable for real-world applications in agriculture

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- 3 Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling after each convolutional layer
- Dropout layer to reduce overfitting
- Fully connected Dense layers
- Softmax output for multi-class classification
